## @SevenOinotna

Hi! I am @SevenOinotna, but in real life people call me **António Neves** — which happens to be my *nickname* read backwards. Born in **Portugal** in 1972, I am **living in Switzerland** since 2006 (*Grüezi, mitenand!*). I am married and have two children.

I work as a software engineer in **FELA Management AG**, a SMB (not the protocol; the abbreviation of _Small and Medium-sized Business_ instead) company with a vast catalog in the transit telematics area. We offer high quality products and services for several rail and bus operators located throughout Europe.
